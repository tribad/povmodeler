# (k)povmodeler

I am trying to make the KDE povmodeler work again. Even it has been develop over a decade ago.
My is a fork from https://github.com/eticre/povmodeler as this code has already been stripped of the KDE specific parts and ported to Qt5.

I think it is a very good starting point to wakeup the many features and ideas already implemented/designed.

The actual code base uses cmake to build the program but I stripped the installation part as it did not realy work for the different plattforms.
So I focused on the splitting the code into several functional units to get a better view into the architecture.

Dont know how long it needs to come along with a good working system. But the first step is always the hardest.
